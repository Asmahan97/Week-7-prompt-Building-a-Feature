# Reflection

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/web-platform-dg1k7g)

I enjoyed working on this feature and I was hoping for it to be a key one in my application. While working on this in Stackblitz, I struggled to get the sun and moon icons to appear. I was able to get them to work in VS Code although the code didn't change. 

The JS code seems to work fine in Stackblitz but not in VS Code and consequently on my application. I don't know if the rest of application's code is the reason for this. In any case, I'll continue to work on this feature as I think it's a fun one to reuse in the future.
